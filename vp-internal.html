            <p>(as adapted from the original Discord post)</p>
            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Lyle and Iâ€™m running for Vice President - Internal on the Full Stack slate with Noah. This past academic year, I served as the VP - Lounge Events for the CSSA.</p>
            <p>My main interests in CS are cybersecurity and software development. Iâ€™m currently finishing up my first Co-op work term at Manitoba Hydro in the cybersecurity department and have previously completed an internship at Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries working in data analysis. In addition to my role in the CSSA, I was also the Student Council President at my high school (for what it&#39;s worth now - it&#39;s been a long time since then!).</p>
            <p>My main hobby outside of school is collecting too many hobbies - I think a lot of us can relate! ðŸ˜… I love reading books: my favourite genres at the moment are non-fiction and modern literary fiction. Iâ€™m also working on my musical chops (mainly guitar and keyboard) and writing my own songs. I also have an interest in film and theatre; I first came to university to pursue a career in film! Iâ€™ve directed a few (embarrassing) short films and have won a local film festival. </p>
            <p>I have four main goals if elected for VP Internal. They are:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Rework the CSSA so that it is more <strong>efficient, effective, and better represents the CS student body.</strong></li>
            <li>Coordinate the activities of CSSA in a <strong>transparent, open manner that is inclusive to all</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Increase student participation</strong> in CSSA events and planning.</li>
            <li><strong>Strengthen</strong> the ties between the UManitoba CS program and outside companies and organizations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 id="why-do-i-want-to-be-vp-internal-">Why do I want to be VP Internal?</h2>
            <p>As most of you may know, I was part of the exec team last year as the Lounge Affairs VP. While I think we got a lot of good work done, I know we could have done much more to make studentsâ€™ experiences much better. Opaqueness, the scheduling and frequency of events, and general disinterest were all problems that students have expressed to myself and the other execs. </p>
            <p>While itâ€™s true that the President(s) have the final say in all decisions, within our current constitution, the VP-Internal (as the main team coordinator of the CSSA) has a unique ability to affect change in the CSSA, both within the team and outside. I would like to take advantage of this unique position to truly change the CSSA for the better.</p>
            <p>Now that weâ€™re back in person and have the support of UMSU, we have the opportunity to <strong>overhaul the CSSA</strong> as a whole and fix these issues. <strong>With a full year of being part of the CSSA under my belt, Iâ€™ve seen where the issues are and how they arise.</strong> I know where the pain points are, and I have a lot of concrete ideas on how to fix it. I believe this gives me a great advantage over a new exec, who may not be as intimately familiar with the CSSAâ€™s issues.</p>
            <h2 id="bringing-in-more-roles-and-reducing-burnout">Bringing in more roles and reducing burnout</h2>
            <p><strong>The CSSA, as a five-to-six-person team, does not have the manpower to adequately represent the ~1000-person-strong Computer Science community at the University of Manitoba.</strong> This put a lot of pressure on every one of the executives last year, resulting in extreme burnout in myself and others. Obviously, this is unsustainable. As the Internal Exec, I would work with the rest of the exec team to create new roles and <strong>expand our executive team</strong>. Some of the roles that I would push for include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Treasurer</strong>: A role to manage the finances of the CSSA, divesting it from the Internal role.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising lead</strong>: Would help create engaging social media posts and advertise on campus.</li>
            <li><strong>Outreach lead</strong>: Connecting with local companies and organizations to bring more opportunities for students to volunteer or further their learning.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="committees-for-non-executives">Committees for non-executives</h2>
            <p>Along with the issue of overworked execs, an issue brought up by students and other candidates is that many students donâ€™t have the opportunity to participate meaningfully in the CSSA outside of voting. The end result of this is that students arenâ€™t excited or are simply too disinterested to participate in our events. This is especially true with first-year students due to the Majors requirement to run for an executive role. </p>
            <p>I will work with the President(s) and the rest of the exec team to create <strong>committees</strong> that non-executive students can apply. These committees would be directed by an elected executive. These would include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Planning Committee</strong>: A group of people that would help the Events exec with planning in-person and virtual events throughout the year.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Committee</strong>: Would help the execs with advertising events on social media and offline.</li>
            <li><strong>Website Committee</strong>: Volunteers that would help update our website and help out with implementing web tools as we need.</li>
            <li><strong>Outreach Committee</strong>: Would help the Outreach VP (see above) with talking to sponsors, organizations, and other external groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Coordination Committee</strong>: A team that would help the execs coordinate all of the events of the year through the whole team and to the faculty.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With these committees, the exec team can stop trying to do everything themselves and start being an actual exec team, with our role being to <strong>manage people within the community</strong>. I will also push to have biweekly or monthly meetings with each of these communities so we can discuss progress and direction.</p>
            <h2 id="running-exec-meetings-more-effectively-and-transparently">Running exec meetings more effectively and transparently</h2>
            <p>A massive inefficiency within the CSSA, mostly due to our small manpower, is that meetings between executives were incredibly long and rambling, and infrequent. Since they were so inefficient, the CSSA also did not have a way to adequately convey the information to you, the CS community.</p>
            <p>As Internal Exec, I propose having <strong>weekly meetings</strong> for our exec team. To keep things quick, I will use parliamentary procedure (Such as Robertâ€™s Rules) to run our meetings more productively. This will make it so that we <strong>spend less time in meetings and more time to focus on engaging with students.</strong> (And our course material, of course!)</p>
            <p>I will also <strong>share our notes after every meeting</strong> so that everyone has the opportunity to see how the CSSA truly operates: more on this below.</p>
            <h2 id="frequent-general-meetings">Frequent general meetings</h2>
            <p>In the last year, the CSSA had exactly <strong>one</strong> general meeting. <strong>This is plainly unacceptable.</strong> This does not help us create an engaged community at all, as shown by the attendance rate of that general meeting. As Internal Exec, I would schedule at least <strong>one general meeting every term</strong> so that each student has the ability to know what we are working on and to voice their concerns.</p>
            <h2 id="better-record-keeping">Better record-keeping</h2>
            <p>Big events like the Game Jam or the mixer are some of the most memorable parts of the school year. As VP Internal, I will make sure that all of these events are documented and posted to our website and social media accounts. Speaking of social media:</p>
            <h2 id="increase-our-social-media-presence">Increase our social media presence</h2>
            <p>I will promise to extend our current social media presence. Right now, the CSSA has an active Instagram account, which we can use to advertise not just our events but any other events that may interest UManitoba CS students. I will also create new YouTube and Twitch channels to post recordings of events, which Noah expands upon in his post.</p>
            <h2 id="expand-umanitoba-computer-science-s-reach-with-industry-and-sponsors">Expand UManitoba Computer Scienceâ€™s reach with industry and sponsors</h2>
            <p>The University of Manitoba is the heart of Winnipegâ€™s tech industry - so many local companies hire from our diverse and talented student base. As VP Internal, Iâ€™d like to leverage these industry connections to create sponsorships for events and job opportunities.</p>
            <p>I will lead the creation of a new tiered sponsorship package so that we raise the awareness of the CSSA locally. I will also support the other execs to reach out to these companies directly, using the teamâ€™s personal connections to employers. I will also like to see us leveraging the departmentâ€™s reach to be able to find even more potential connections.</p>
            <h2 id="overhaul-the-discord-and-the-way-we-communicate">Overhaul the Discord and the way we communicate</h2>
            <p>One big problem for the CSSA (and the other two clubs) is the way the Discord server currently operates. The CS Lounge Discord has been a boon to our communities throughout COVID. Without it, my social circle would undoubtedly be smaller.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the Discord server has seen better days. Oftentimes, new students do not know that this server exists. I believe this problem is twofold.</p>
            <p>First, we need to overhaul the way we advertise the server and how we invite others. When speaking to new people, they often say that they only heard about the server through word-of-mouth. When they finally do know about the server, they often find they can&#39;t get get in due to a bottleneck. I would work to <strong>automate the invite process</strong> so that every student who wants to participate in our online community can.</p>
            <p>Second, we need to lessen our reliance on the server since it is becoming our main form of communication. Not everyone in CS is on Discord, or even wants to be. With people on campus and increasingly going to events offline, we need to increase our in-person presence. <strong>The CSSA is not just a Discord server.</strong> I propose that we rely more on traditional social media (see above), in-class and in-person advertising, and community-focused events in order to communicate with people.</p>
            <h2 id="greater-collaboration-with-devclub-and-wics">Greater collaboration with .devClub and WICS</h2>
            <p>While all three of our groups do collaborate, we can do much more to coordinate our events and help each other out. Iâ€™d like to see us advertising each otherâ€™s events, and collaborate in the planning process: I will push for more joint events that all groups can participate in. </p>
            <p>That being said, all three groups are independent for a reason - inter-club collaboration is great, but I also respect .devClub and WICS being separate groups. Iâ€™d like to move forward in a way that is more collaborative but respects the will of all groups.</p>
            <h2 id="planning-out-the-whole-term">Planning out the whole term</h2>
            <p>As part of collaborating with the other two groups and to budget, I will push for a way to plan out the whole term in advance. This would include any events that any of the three groups are planning and helps us avoid awkward scheduling conflicts, both within our groups and with exams and holidays.</p>
            <p>I plan to create a public calendar for events, to be accessible from our website, which can be easily accessed by any student. This calendar should also be shown during our general meetings (see above).</p>
            <h2 id="drafting-a-new-constitution">Drafting a new constitution</h2>
            <p>All of these changes will require a great change in the CSSA and how it is defined legally. To better represent you, the CSSA needs to move forward and stop repeating the mistakes of the past - the best way we can do this is to change the structure of the CSSA at a fundamental level. As Internal exec, I will work with the exec team to <strong>draft a new constitution</strong>, keeping in UMSU guidelines, and voted in by <strong>you, the CS community</strong>.  </p>
            <h2 id="about-full-stack">About Full Stack</h2>
            <p>A lot of these student-based changes will need the support of the other execs, especially the Events VP. Thatâ€™s why I have chosen to run on a slate with Noah Curoe who drafted this plan with me. I am excited to be working with him as I think we have created a campaign that all students can be excited about!</p>
            <p>Thank you very much for your consideration and support! ðŸ˜„ Letâ€™s all work together to make this year the best year of CS in the University of Manitoba to date!
            </p>
