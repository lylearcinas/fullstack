                            <p>"I wanted to share my thoughts on my friends Lyle Arcinas and Noah Curoe, who are running for student positions in the Computer Science Student Association. I&#39;ve had the pleasure of knowing Lyle and Noah in an academic setting, and I can vouch for their exceptional qualities.
                            <p>Lyle and I were in the same HCI group, and he was instrumental in making our group project a success. His collaboration and organization skills are top-notch, and he&#39;s always willing to lend a helping hand. I&#39;ve seen him work wholeheartedly for the Computer Science Student Association, and I know he would make an outstanding VP Internal.
                            <p>Noah is an amazing person and a great friend. We&#39;ve worked together in Tech Comm and Databases 2 group, and I&#39;ve learned so much from him. His intelligence, hard work, and proactive nature are remarkable, and he always takes his responsibilities seriously. I&#39;m confident that he would make an excellent VP events candidate.
                            <p>As part of the Full Stack Slate, Lyle and Noah are dedicated to advancing the interests of computer science students and the community. Their involvement in various initiatives and events demonstrates their passion for making a positive impact. I wholeheartedly endorse them for their student positions and wish them the best of luck in their campaigns.
                            <p>Lyle and Noah are both exceptional individuals who genuinely care about their peers and the community. They have the qualities and skills needed to excel in their respective positions, and I have no doubt they will make a positive impact. If you&#39;re looking for hardworking, dedicated individuals who truly care, then Lyle and Noah are the candidates to support."</q>
