         <p>Hello Everyone! I'm Noah Curoe, running for Vice-President of Events this year, on the slate Full Stack with Lyle!</p>
         <p>I am a fourth year Computer Science Co-op student expecting to graduate at the end of next year. I've previously worked at Ubisoft and Blaze Canada for my coop terms and have an internship lined up at Inworld AI this summer. At heart I'm a tech nerd. Instead of paying for Google Drive or renting a VPS from AWS, you'll find a server in my basement hosting all of these services for me. This frugal mindset has also led to some other hobbies, such as cooking and doing handiwork around the house (which maybe lead to ONE OR TWO electrical fires OK but come on its not that bad).</p>
         <p>If elected as VP Events for the coming year, I have two primary goals that I would like to work towards with the rest of the CSSA executive team:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Introduce new types of events which push to <b>build a stronger relationship</b> between the CS student body and members of the CS department and industry; and</strong></li>
            <li><b>Improving approachability</b> of all CSSA events to increase student engagement.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>These two goals are of course in addition to bringing back the fun events from past years!</p>
         <h2 id="new-events">New Events</h2>
         <p>Hosting events that connect computer science students with members of the computer science industry is crucial for providing students with the resources they need to succeed in their studies and future careers. I think a lot of students are adverse to traditional networking events, so I am interested in exploring ideas that <b>combine industry involvement</b> with an event format that students would otherwise be interested in attending.</p>
         <h3 id="new-events-guest-speaker-series">Guest speaker series</h3>
         <p>I would like to see an event where presenters can register to deliver <b>talks for any variety of subjects within CS</b>. These presenters can range from alumni, faculty, or industry experts. Winnipeg has a significant hackerspace and tech convention presence who run events like this already on a broader scale, and after speaking with some members of faculty, I believe the CSSA hosting an event like this is not only feasible, but by collaborating with the computer science department, we could see strong involvement from industry experts as well.</p>
         <h3 id="new-events-live-competition">Live competition event (CTF)</h3>
         <p>The summer programming contest is a great event (which I would like to bring back for this year!), but I also believe there is potential for an <b>in-person competition event</b>. Following a CTF format, we could have a <b>team-based competition</b> with a variety of challenges in different subject areas such as algorithms, automation, security, and more! This not only provides an opportunity for students to learn new skills, but also gives a chance to bring in industry experts for presentations, or in judging or mentorship roles.</p>
         <h3 id="new-events-beyond-industry">Casual events</h3>
         <p>Of course, not every event needs to have a greater goal than just letting students have some fun; I will also be looking for opportunities for casual events too. For example, if elected, I'd like to get started right away by organizing a <b>summer event</b> to let us capitalize on the nice weather, as we donâ€™t get much time in the year to get out and enjoy the sun.</p>
         <h2 id="improving-events">Improving Events</h2>
         <p>Beyond new events, I think there are ways the execution of these events can be improved from previous years to be more approachable to students. I've heard many anecdotes of students who have wanted to particiapte in CSSA events in the past, but either couldn't, or felt too nervous to jump into. I have a few concrete ideas that I'd like to look into implementing to touch on this.</p>
         <h3 id="improving-events-adhoc">More adhoc and small-scale events</h3>
         <p>Popping in to the CSSA movie nights last Fall when I was free was really fun, and I hope to be able to help bring back not only <b>movie nights</b>, but other small-scale events too. <b>Game nights or tournaments, study sessions, and casual hangouts</b> are all a great way for students to meet new people and get more comfortable participating in CSSA events when they don't need to worry about coming up with project ideas or organizing a team.</p>
         <h3 id="improving-events-scheduling">Better event scheduling</h3>
         <p>I couldn't tell you how many times I've heard students say they wanted to participate in an event, but they couldn't because it just had to be scheduled the weekend before all of the second year courses decided to hold midterms. With better planning and more communication with the CS department, <b>conflicts like this can be avoided</b> to allow more students to participate in CSSA's best gatherings.</p>
         <h3 id="improving-events-livestreaming">High quality event livestreaming and recording</h3>
         <p>While in-person events should be geared towards in-person attendance, I also think it is worth including those who aren't able to attend live. I appreciate the past exec team turning a laptop webcam towards the presenter last minute, but I think with a little bit of (not very expensive) equipment and planning, we can do a lot better. I'd like to see event presentations and workshops <b>livestreamed and recorded</b> to allow busy students to still engage with the community even if they don't have time to fully participate. This also give students who are hesitant to participate in large-scale events a taste of what they are like, and allows us to have <b>an archive of the great projects and knowledge</b> produced and shared by students in our community. There are of course a lot of privacy concerns with livestreaming and recording, so the semantics of how this can be accomplished properly will need some planning.</p>
         <h2 id="ia-collaboration">Collaboration with Internal Affairs</h2>
         <p>My goal of making our events accessible by livestreams and recordings will require <b>coordination with the elected Vice President Internal Affairs</b>, which is a big part of why I am running on a slate with Lyle. My goal is to work together to <b>update the CSSA website and expand our social media presence</b> to other platforms like Youtube to bring this to reality.</p>
         <p>You may be thinking all of this will be a lot of work for such a small team of executive members to properly execute. A big part of carrying out these ideas will be bringing on more students to help out. I'd like to push for <b>additional appointed and volunteer positions</b> within the CSSA not only to help make our events bigger and better than ever before, but also because it gives students an opportunity to get involved with the CS community and gain hands-on experience in student leadership roles <b>without needing to commit to running for an elected position</b>. This is yet another reason that I am running on a slate with Lyle, as bringing in more CSSA positions will require coordination with the Internal Affairs VP. I strongly encourage you to read through Lyle's campaign platform to learn more about what we would like to see here.</p>
         <h2 id="why-me-for-events">Why Vote For Me for VP Events?</h2>
         <p>My passion for computer science isn't just for show. I have a lot of experience with programming and working on CS related projects and organizations as part of a team. I have experience setting up hardware and service infrastructure as well, which is an important component to being able to, say, host a programming contest that needs a bot to check answers and track scores, or to build and configure the setup needed to provide the high quality livestreams that I mentioned earlier. I think ultimately I can utilize my tech-nerd no-lifing to contribute anything necessary to help drive CSSA events. Beyond skills, I also have industry and faculty connections that I can leverage to bring my goals for stronger industry collaboration to fruition.</p>
